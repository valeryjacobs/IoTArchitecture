Begin with an intro statement with the following details:

- Solution overview
 
- Key technologies used
 
- Core Team: Names, roles and Twitter handles 


## Customer profile ##
This section will contain general information about the customer, including the following:

- Company name and URL

- Company description

- Company location

- What are their product/service offerings?



 
## Problem statement ##


This section will define the problem(s)/challenges that the customer wants to address with an IoT solution. Include things like costs, customer experience, etc.
 
*If you’d really like to make your write-up pop, include a customer quote that highlights the customer’s problem(s)/challenges.*


 
## Solution and steps ##


The majority of your win artifacts will be included in this section, including (but not limited to) the following: Pictures, drawings, architectural diagrams, value stream mappings and demo videos.

This section should include the following details:

- What was worked on and what problem it helped solve.

- Architecture diagram/s (**required**). Example below:

**Directions for adding images:**

1. Create a folder for your project images in the “images” folder in the GitHub repo files. This is where you will add all of the images associated with your write-up.
 
2. Add links to your images using the following absolute path:

  `![Description of the image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/projectname/myimage.png)`
    
  Here’s an example: 

  `![Value Stream Mapping]({{site.baseurl}}/images/orckestra/orckestra2.jpg)`

 Note that capitalization of the file name and the file extension must match exactly for the images to render properly.

*If you’d really like to make your write-up pop, include a customer quote that highlights the solution.*
